      <h2>Review Profiles and Reviews Carefully</h2>
      <p>Take the time to carefully review member profiles. Read what members say about themselves and what other members have said about them. Give yourself the time to thoroughly read through all the information available and don’t compromise. If you’re uncomfortable, keep looking. But please don't judge hosts by their profile pictures. You'll be surprised how kind of a host a pile of goop can be.</p>

      <h2>Trust your instincts</h2>
      <p>If an organism seems unsafe for any reason, run. Don’t worry about seeming rude. Chances are you can tell them that's how life on your planet says hello. We encourage creativity in times of trouble.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Have A Backup Plan</h2>
      <p>Know your options. If something doesn’t work out with your host, or if they misrepresented themselves, their home, or the makeup of their atmosphere, make sure you have an alternate place to stay. Identify the nearest hostel, hotel, or subterranean cavern, or have a backup host in place before you go. If possible, research your host’s neighborhood prior to arriving, including how to get to and from there on your own and in pitch black darkness.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Be Informed about the culture where you are traveling</h2>
      <p>Do your homework, and be sure you’re aware of cultural variance and differences in non-linear relativistic mechanics, superstring sensitivities, and general safety of the local fruits and vegetables for each place that you travel. Conversation patterns and logical formulations can differ wildly.</p>
